README for Different Border-Radius Rectangles in HTML with CSS
---------------------------------------------------------------

This README provides instructions on how to create 9 different border-radius rectangles in HTML using CSS. By following these steps, you can easily create various rectangular shapes with different corner radius values. Here's how to get started:

1. HTML Structure:
   - Begin by opening the HTML file where you want to create the border-radius rectangles.
   - Inside the `<body>` element, create a `<div>` element for each rectangle shape.
   - Use appropriate IDs or classes for the div elements to apply CSS styling later.

2. CSS Styling:
   - Open your CSS file or create a new one.
   - Select each div element using its ID or class and apply desired styling. For example:
     ```css
     #rectangle1 {
       width: 200px;
       height: 100px;
       border-radius: 0;
     }
     #rectangle2 {
       width: 200px;
       height: 100px;
       border-radius: 10px;
     }
     /* Add styles for the remaining rectangles as per your desired designs */
     ```
   - Customize the styles further by adjusting the width, height, border-radius, background color, border color, or other desired attributes for each rectangle.

3. Apply CSS to HTML:
   - In your HTML file, link the CSS file by adding the following line of code within the `<head>` section:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/css-file.css">
     ```
   - Replace `"path/to/your/css-file.css"` with the actual path to your CSS file.

4. Add Rectangles to HTML:
   - In your HTML file, within the `<body>` section, add the div elements for each rectangle shape. For example:
     ```html
     <div id="rectangle1"></div>
     <div id="rectangle2"></div>
     <!-- Add div elements for the remaining rectangles as per your desired designs -->
     ```

5. Save and Preview:
   - Save both your HTML and CSS files.
   - Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the 9 different border-radius rectangles with the applied CSS styles.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and styled 9 different border-radius rectangles in HTML using CSS. Feel free to customize the rectangles further by adjusting the styles, changing the border-radius values, or incorporating any desired features to suit your project's requirements.
